# React and Superagent Application with Node, Express, Redis, and Docker

Our application is built using React and Superagent on the client side, and Node with Express on the server side. We are also using Redis as our data store, and we'll set up Redis using Docker as described below. This document provides you with an overview of the application, its features, and instructions on how to set it up and run it.

## Description

This application is a web-based system that leverages React on the front end to provide a user-friendly interface. Superagent is used to make HTTP requests to the server, which is powered by Node and Express. Redis is used as the data store to efficiently manage and store data. The application allows you to perform various tasks that interact with the server and the Redis data store.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for the server
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - An in-memory data store
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization platform
- A modern web browser
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Navigate to the project's root directory and install the required dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```bash
   cd your-app-directory
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**:

   You may need to configure your Redis server and other settings in the application. The configuration files can be found in the `config` folder.

4. **Build the React App**:

   To build the React application, run the following command inside the `client` directory:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:

   Start the server and the React app by running the following command in the root directory:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start both the server and the React app.

## Setting up Redis with Docker

To set up Redis as a database and run it in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**:

   If you haven't already, install Docker on your machine. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Pull Redis Image**:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to pull the Redis image. The version 4.0.1 is specified to ensure compatibility with our code:

   ```bash
   docker pull redis:4.0.1
   ```

3. **Run Redis Container**:

   Start a Redis container using the following command. It exposes Redis on port 6379 and names the container "some-redis":

   ```bash
   docker run -p 6379:6379 --name some-redis -d redis:4.0.1
   ```

   This will run a Redis container in the background.

4. **Install Redis for Node.js**:

   To ensure compatibility with the Redis version in the Docker container, install Redis version 4.0.1 for Node.js using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install redis@4.0.1
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the provided package.json starter file and run `npm install` with it. Inside the downloaded folder, use "RedisDockerDemo."

## Usage

After setting up the application and Redis, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Here are some common tasks you can perform with the application:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**:

   - Sign up for a new user account.
   - Log in with your credentials.
   - Log out from your account.

2. **Interact with Data**:

   - Create, read, update, and delete data stored in Redis.
   - Use Superagent to send HTTP requests to the server to manipulate data.

3. **Other Features**:

   - Explore additional features that the application offers.
